# Surfs Up!
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze weather data in Hawaii. This is needed due to a desire to open up a surf and
ice cream shop. The potential investor of this project W. Avy wants to see the weather data before investing.

## Results
The results of the analysis are as follows:

![June Temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71234992/100688226-1698c900-333f-11eb-9a11-e01ba5baabc6.PNG)
![December Temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71234992/100688224-15679c00-333f-11eb-9123-caae8c363762.PNG)

* As can be see the temperatures do not vary much from June to December with the average going from 75 to 71.
* Fortunately all year round is ice cream weather with the min temperature being only 56.
* The max temperature in December was surprisingly above the average temperature in June

## Summary
Overall it appears that there is ample evidence to convince W. Avy that all year round is ice cream weather. Therefore, 
if that is what was determining whether he would invest, he should definitely invest. Two additional queries that could 
be made would be looking at a wider range of years and/or getting more date points.
